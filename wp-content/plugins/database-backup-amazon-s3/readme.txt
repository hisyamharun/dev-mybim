Database Backup Amazon S3 is a new plugin, so we tried have to provide a bug-free plugin/widget. We are maintain this project.

Being one of the most prominent retailers in the world, Amazon has special data safety and backup requirements. That is why in 2011 Amazon ceased utilizing tape backup and launched Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) where it keeps the most part of its Oracle databases. This highly effective business solution has many adopters worldwide, WPAdm is one of them. This solution allowed to diminish the general difficulty and cost of the backup procedures at the same time increasing performance. S3 eliminates the necessity of constant storage capacity evaluation thus enhancing staff efficiency as the employees become available for more important tasks.

= WPAdm Challenges =

* In terms of backup, the software licenses for tape systems maintenance is a significant expense item. Automated tape systems allow to perform basic read/write operations but without special proprietary software their functions and efficiency are severely limited. As the backup process is crucial for safety and stability these expenditures cannot be discarded. Comparatively high cost of the tape software and desire to optimize the process forces to consider alternative backup solutions.

* Tape is able to provide a rather high level of archival stability though multiple copies should be made for additional durability. Another significant challenge is to increase initially low data search and recovery speed. Tape robots are able to search and restore information reasonably fast when nothing interferes with the automated process. The slightest hardware failure requires immediate staff attention which considerably affects time-efficiency. Furthermore, tape drives are unable to handle multiple requests quickly enough. Keeping backup files in cloud storages is free of the aforementioned drawbacks and seems a far more effective solution for recovery procedures.<br /> 
To initiate a restoration procedure from tapes you have to retrieve physical copies, while S3 back up data is always available, then this need is arises. In fact Amazon S3 back up eliminates the previously in avoidable delay in case a database administrator needs to restore any lost information. 

**Information about privacy:** <br />
AFTER the user has been registered at WPAdm service AND has confirmed their registration,
our plugin will get the minimum requirements of PHP and MySQL configuration, version and language of WordPress.
This data will be send to WPAdm service, to get the plugin work correctly, to extend supported configurations of user sites with WPAdm-extensions and support.<br />
WE DO NOT COLLECT AND DO NOT STORE THE PERSONAL DATA OF USERS FROM THIS PLUGIN!

Vast arrays of a wide variety of data burst into our lives like a landslide, filling all the space on our hosting or server. We store various data on server or hosting space. Such data can be e.g. text, software, photo, music or video. Any user data, regardless of type, occupy a certain space on the disk. For each type of data you want to back up. Depending on the type of backup files take up a lot of disk space. Furthermore, in case of difficulty a copy of the data on the same disk just can't help you. If a website has been hacked or data was corrupted by a virus or you made the wrong system setup and that's all... Your website is no longer available. From these reasons, the backup storage should be done outside of your host (hosting) or server. Where it is safe for your data, where there is no active virus and where hackers have nothing to do. Usually such a place can be a backup place, backup in one of cloud services online. That service can be any Cloud or your own server, which stands on a separate network or an entire separate protected network infrastructure.


<strong>Backup and archiving sensitive data - Important questions for web shop owner</strong>
WooCommerce owners (online shop) have to observe all sorts of things for their shops. Not only topics such as WooCommerce marketing, WooCommerce optimization, WooCommerce customer service and webpage speed are important, but also unpopular things like WooCommerce backup and WooCommerce security. Experience has shown time and again that their own WooCommerce backup of the data doesn't get the attention that should be given up for WooCommerce eCommerce web shop. A failure of the technique, a defective hard disk or a hacker attack can simply ensure that the entire operation of the WooCommerce online shop must be set. This can prevent the worst regular WooCommerce backups and one-time WooCommerce backups.

<strong>Secure backup for shops: interface and customers data. Why save? Good reasons, that require a secure backup</strong>
Probably the most important reason for data backup seems to be the continuation of the own company. It should be obvious that a sudden defective Shop software can cause huge problems. Without worked Shop - no sales! Reasons that can lead to non-functioning of the WooCommerce shop, for example, WooCommerce updates, WooCommerce attacks as a result of poor security or installing new WooCommerce modules. An iron principle should be that before any amendment of the shop system, both the database and the shop software of WooCommerce has to be secured itself.

= The Benefits Amazon S3 website backup = 

As WPADM found outs, implementation of Amazon S3 service instead of tape-based systems is provides certain advantages, such as:<br />
• There is no need to spend time and efforts on tape capacity evaluation, which is crusial for fast-growing companies. The cloud-based backup system allows to keep up with ultimately any rate of expansion without any hardware or software issues. Unlike tape storage with limited capacity the data may be uploaded to S3 virtually with no limitations. The customers pay for the space they use – no more, no less. The elimination of tape planning means that the customers don't need to plan their backup volume in advance, in they need more space, they simply get it for additional price. <br />
• Automated tape systems (tape robots and tape drives), datacenter space, maintence hardware, proprietary software are no longer needed. This allows to diminish overall expenditures on capital backup equipment which previously had to be planned in advance in terms of corporate budget. <br />
